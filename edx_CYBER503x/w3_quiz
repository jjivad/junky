The formula for determining adverse impact is:
Impact = Likelihood * Value

When determining threat likelihood, most processes look at a timeframe of:
One year

Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) is:
The total amount of revenue that is lost from a single occurrence of the risk

The Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO) is:
The number of times an organization can reasonably expect the risk to occur during one year

Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) is:
The total amount of money an organization will lose in one year if nothing is done to mitigate the risk

Risk Management 2 Quiz

UNIT 3: Question 1
What are some sources to identify vulnerabilities? (Select all that apply)
*Existing security requirement checklists
*Previous risk assessment documents
*Reports from vulnerability scanning tools and penetration tests
*External vulnerability sources

UNIT 3: Question 2
Likelihood is:
The probability that a threat will occur
*The probability that a threat will occur against a vulnerability with existing controls in place
The probability that a vulnerability will be exploited

UNIT 3: Question 3
What is the formula for Impact Analysis?
ALE (Annual Loss Expectance) = SLE * ARO (Annual Rate of Occurrence)
*Magnitude of Risk Impact = Likelihood * Asset Value
Single Loss Expectance (SLE) = Exposure Factor * Asset Value

UNIT 3: Question 4
Which is the correct formula for cost-benefit analysis in the risk mitigation phase?
ROSI = (ALE after control) – (ALE before control) – (annual cost of control)
ROSI = (ALE after control) – (ALE before control) – (asset value)
*ROSI = (ALE before control) – (ALE after control) – (annual cost of control)

UNIT 3: Question 5
What are the two key components of risk?
Asset, Likelihood
*Magnitude of impact value, Likelihood
Threat, Magnitude of impact value

UNIT 3: Question 6
The well-formed risk statement always contains: (Select three)
*Asset value
*Existing controls
Single Loss Expectance (SLE)
Return On Security Investment (ROSI)
*Vulnerability-Threat pair

UNIT 3: Question 7
Which statement is not true about vulnerability?
Vulnerability is a weakness in the system.
*Vulnerability focuses on “what you are afraid of or are trying to avoid”
Vulnerability focuses on “how the threat could occur”

UNIT 3: Question 8
The Risk Matrix is a conventional qualitative risk assessment method that requires consistent definitions for: (Select three)
*Asset exposure level for vulnerability-threat pair
*Impact levels or effects
*Likelihood levels
Annual Loss Expectance (ALE)

UNIT 3: Question 9
Risk mitigation attempts to reduce risk by: (Select three)
Constant system monitoring
*Limiting the asset exposure to the risk
*Limiting the impact of the risk if it does occur
*Reducing the probability or likelihood of the risk affecting your business
